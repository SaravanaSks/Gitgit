SUMMARY - Fourth Week…


    This was my fourth week of my internship, and in this internship I have learnt very new things which I don’t even know before, and it was still exciting me to know these stuffs, In this week I learnt about the HTML tags and Css how its working in it and then also tried to do that by this by designing the UI which was given by my mentor, at first It was little hard to learn the basic things also, but the help with my mentors and others in office I  learnt few things about HTML and CSS, and also came through how to program in correct form.


    And first I have learnt about how to create a simple web page by using the html and then learnt about how to apply css styles in it to look good the previous one. And then learnt how to add the background by using the link and also it excited me to know more, so I added the text style by using the link from the google fonts lato, and it was look much better than previous one, and then my mentor asked me to align it in the correct order, so i tried to do that in correct order by using the margin and padding in it. And then asked me to add the button in it and also explained to me how it should look and then I tried to do  that by using the button tag and also placed it with the required label. And then created it with correct alignment he asked me to add the submit button which will use to submit the input, and also did the alert box to display it, So i have learnt this much in this week all about html and css, 


    And Anna took a session as culture talks in thursday, and in it he explained  what is accountability and responsibility in very different way, and also taught us about how do not be guilty because of refused to keep the words, but it was very different to us, if i didn’t do the work which I took as my responsibility then I supposed to feel guilty that's how we used to, but anna said it is not worth of it and try to complete  the work. And also looking for the upcoming culture talks to learn new things from him.
