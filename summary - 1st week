SUMMARY - FOR WEEK 1:


This was my first week of intern, and here I have learnt few things till now, and also practising and trying to do same for rest of the days, At first I came to know that every IT cannot be same as with separate cabins, ID cards and along with work tension, But here its very different for me and also wondered everyone here enjoying their work also having fun sometimes. It's really cool.

    For first week I have learnt What surfboard payments doing and how it works,Surfboard payments trying to make a payments method easier in future by developing the app to pay easily without wasting few times for that, and they already developed and launched the Surfpay app which was working in mobile phone and customers can made a payments by tapping a card on mobile, and also they have a Dashboard used to update the info and maintaining the sales percentage and to know the number of sales, and checkouts placed in point of sale it used to save time and increasing the sales and also don’t want to interact with sales person.

    Also for this week i learnt problem solving, it means if facing any problem first need to understand the problem why it exist, and have to list out the constraints and then have to know the possibilities and at last rearranging the possibilities which leads to solve the problem, and it's very different way for me to approach a problem, but after i learnt I’m practicing it to apply when I have a problem, and will follow the same,

    And I gone through about the command lines used to access the system by using the commands in terminal, actually I'm new to this, but its very exciting to learn by accessing the system by using the command lines, also know how to create, delete, rename, move or copy a file/folder, and still searching new commands which can help me in this, and also practicing this  everyday since I started to learning, and also know how the basic computer works along with the hardware and softwares, softwares or OS used to communicate with the hardware in computer and accessing the system by converting the embedded language into programmed language, Also applications are used to make our work much easier, also knew about how the hardwares are working in system, the RAM is collecting data from secondary memory when the electronic energy hits to starts the system, and also know transistor used to transmitting the binary inputs into the system language, and also know cache used to save the data for few times to access the files easily by user’s inputs, And also capacitor used to store the electronic energy for some times, and RAM is a volatile so it cannot store the data for long time when the secondary memory can store the data for longtime and its non-volatile, also RAM developed as semi conductors while Hard Disk  formed with magnetic tapes.

    Also had some session to know these things, and also sriram showed us how to create the application, first need to list out the requirements and data to develop the app, and also learnt how to breakdown the app as UI and required data, And also it very good to do like that, and also solved some puzzles to practicing the problem solving method, At friday had a demo meeting and all of us shared that what we have learnt for this week, except interns other showed and explained what they were working for a week and these are very new to us, And very exciting to learn such things in upcoming days.
