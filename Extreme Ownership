EXTREME OWNERSHIP:

    This book was written by the jocko willink, Leif Babin served us US SEAL officers in an urban combat, Did most highly operations in Iraq war, this book was written by them to explain about what is extreme leadership among the people and how to become like that with the qualities based on the principles of leadership, and how to act.


INTRODUCTION:

    This book starts with the introduction explained about their experience in the war zone of iraq, and it was dark silent night, the navy SEALs kitted up with the helmets, guns, body armors and the gears they required in that war place along with the Iraq soldiers, they started to secure people in that war zone from the enemies who all were the al Qaeda, and the SEALs and iraq soldiers were attacked by them, for the security purpose and intention of securing the innocent people the SEALs and Iraq soldiers also attacked the enemies with the guns and tanks belongs to the US army,  The humvees pushed forward and SEALs manning the machine gun to give the fire support for their team, 

    And also They found the squirter who shot the SEALs and Iraq soldiers, while they tried to caught him, He started to escaping from the SEAls but at some time he get caught by the SEALs, the squirter he was the middle-aged Iraq man, after caught him they checked whether he had any bombs or he was came to attack them with a explosive sucide belt. And then the enemies started to attack the SEAL and Iraq soldiers with their guns and explosives, and SEALs got stuck between the enemies and they attacked them frequently, so they had to do combat attack Cover and move, simple, prioritize and execute and Decentralized command. As per the combat attack they started to attack the enemies back and then they ran to the safer place by changing their position, So they escaped from the enemies while shooting towards them, in that the commander shot few enemies with his gun. So they worked as a team and defeated the enemies with the team spirit,  
In this if the group  of people worked together as a team they can succeed in anything they want.



CHAPTER 1: Extreme Ownership:


    In this chapter, the author wrote about the war zone where he served as an operation commander, and it was a little fog morning and they walked into the street where the US army tank was, and also the red smoke grenades also used in several places to notify that places need the Help.  And there was totally three hundred US - iraq- friendly forces operating in that dangerous place where the jihad hiding there to attack the SEALs and other rescue and operations team, the operation was started as fighting with the enemies and US troops had got the informations and incoming report by a radio to know what happening there, US Marine Corps ANGLICO - Air Naval Gunfire Liaison Company worked along the american attack aircraft to drop the bombs in enemies places where they are,  after few hours The SEAL sniper team started into a serious gunfire, And the SEALs of the commander cleared some sector in the buildings and making the way for everyone to get safe to make a fire against the enemies to safe themselves, 

    At some time, the humvee targeted the building with the weapon and commander stepped into the street and asked about the happening things, they replied that one muj inside the building and killed one  of the Iraq soldier, but the one of SEAL sniper team was nearby the target building so commander asked to stop such things and get near by the team and started to do the friendly fire with the command blue in blue, but it was not went well, it became crazy for them too. And they faced some difficulties because of unplanned actions and the operation got stopped as CO and Investigation officer and command master chief enroute to the place, and after returned to their place they had a discussion that who was responsible for the failure, and at that time the commander took a responsibility for the failure while the everyone blamed on themselves, 

Conclusion - In an organization the Superior person should take the responsibility to increase the profit or working efficiency without blaming on anyone, this is the first thing of extreme ownership, Extreme ownership needs a leader to look at an organization’s problem and have to build a better and efficient team with extreme ownership junior leader take charge of the smaller teams and their piece of missions,  as a leader he/she should accept the mistakes and failures and also try avoid that afterwards. Best leader should blame himself/herself for the failures. 




CHAPTER 2: No bad Team, Only Bad Leaders:


In this chapter, the Author explained about the Hell week of SEAL Training, in that hell week they will conduct the very hard training for nearly two hundred young men, in this training there will be the boat race conducted between the students of that SEALs, and they were splitted into six teams, And it will pay for the winners as they will take rest after winning the race and have to watch the race of rest of the team, The instructor gave the detailed and complicated instructions to the team and started the race. He instructed the team by using the megaphones, And in the race boat crew 2 won every single race and also they performed well and Boat crew 6 did a standout performance but they lost the race so the instructor and SEAL officers became concerned about them and gave a punishment for them.
    After that, the crew of boat 6 was blaming each others for their lost, at that case the SEAL  thought about swapping the boat 2 and boat 6 leaders for each other boats, but boat 2 crew leader felt bad for this but he can’t ignore the order, so per order he took a position as leader in the boat 6 and then the boat 6 leader took a position as leader for boat 2 and then the race was conducted, in that race the boat 6 crew won as first and the boat 2 lost the race, in this case found that the team needs a best leader to achieve  the goal. In the principle when leaders follows the extreme ownership principle they will achieve the high standard performance and they will recognize that also,  the leader should pull the different elements and different methods and giving the instruction to the team members to achieve the goal, 

In application of that the author visited the company to teach about the extreme ownership for the employees and superior persons of that organization. In the company the employees are not performed well and also not profitable, so he took a session about the extreme ownership to the CTO but he always took a stand that he right all the time, for the leadership the first thing is to accept the mistakes of themselves, and after that he should take care of the entire team and of the one person of that team not performed well the leader should make sure that person learnt such things to do. A leader must find the effective way and drive high performance within the team to win.




CHAPTER 3: Believe:

This chapter explains about the believe, the work up consisted of training in desert, urban and also in vehicles, boats, planes, helicopters and also on foot. Also they fired thousands of rounds, also deals with the hundreds of push-ups and pull-ups in the training session in the SEAL, they also had some best gears in the worlds like encrypted radio, night vision goggles, infrared lasers like that, and in this chapter the author mentioned about the Iraq soldiers who all are very weak and worst combat troops, uneducated, unmotivated people and they always don’t believe in themselves too, most of them have joined in the troops for the paycheck only. Also few of them cannot even do push ups also. Some of them are of questionable loyalty for the new government because some soldiers remained loyal to Saddam who was very dangerous. Also the gears of Iraq soldiers are also not well and their armor also looked like an old one. 

In a mission the iraq soldiers fighting with the mujahideen fighters who all are tried to kill them, so the SEAL run for the gun sound, but in the iraq soldier troop they don’t even believe on someone of same troop because the trustworthy was checked there, but in the SEAL they having the brotherhood or else they can’t win against anyone. In that situation the  commander asked more questions to himself to understand that time in ramadi, and also thinked about how he can prepare the iraq soldiers to save themselves from the dangerous mujahideens, after that had a talk with officers to make the best understandable  things why the operation important and the leader should have the ability to make the team believe him in any hard times,

Conclusion - The leader should convince and inspire others to follow the certain things made by the leader in some situations, leaders also should have faith in him/her or else they can’t convince the other people. Leader should align his thoughts and vision on the mission when he believes it will be a chain of command and actions also should reflect in the confidence and the performance of the leader. All leaders should be able to know the strategic order of the mission and also if the leader got any order he must be able to ask why when it required to know and analyze the situation of the mission 



CHAPTER 4: Check the ego.


    Enemies were started to attack on the US outpost and American soldiers also started to attack them harshly with the machine guns and the assault rifles, the commander(author) and Leif were get into the field the commander took a position in machine gun and Leif was next to him also fighting against the enemies, This was happened on Ramadi and it was fully chaos and dangerous war zone at iraq, Many attacks followed with the same pattern by attacking on the american outpost, at one time enemies used the very dangerous weapon as suicidal attack as VBIED suicide bomber driving a large truck withg full of explosives, if this happend it shhould be the major loss for the entire American Navy and SEALs, But the missile launched from navy warship to drop the bomb on that. In this chapter I learnt that the way the SEALs and navy started to defend the enemies in that war zone, Seals and Task unit bruisers worked together by checking their ego.

    After a month Task unit bruiser made a mark then it was easy for the SEALs to find the enemies position and and made more damage to the enemies, they fought with those jihad for some while, in iraq they were did a lot of unforgettable and cruel stuffs there like torture, rape and murder ruthlessly terrorize, intimidate and rule over the peoples, and then at some time SEALs got a well trained Iraq army unit in the war zone for the further assistance in that hell where the jihads hiding some where to make an attack, the joined new people in that mission was iraq army unit they were well shaved and better haircut like representing the army in thier appearence also. But they don't have the mentality as a team they always looked like a individual, 


    So at some time commander had a talk with the platoon commander and he used to supports them only, in a conversation alo he said they were best and they can handle it alone also without the SEALs and other supporting troops, Commander shocked and realized that he has a Ego with that, and he explained the way they should work along with the team not because of Ego, and then at some time platoon commander was not able to help and colonel directed the unit to leave the camp as they cant work with the team where some people ego prevented them from fully integrating with the 1/506th battalion.

Conclusion: Ego will cloud everything, planning process, ability to take good advice and also the steps to follow in an operation. Everyone has an ego and it will drive most of the people in their lifetime, also restricting the person from a team play. If the person becomes egoistic then it will be destructive and while personal agendas take place they will forget the team. Implementing Extreme ownership need to check the ego and high degree humility, admitting mistakes, taking ownership to developing a plan to overcome challenges integral to any successful team, So controlling an Ego is more  important.  



CHAPTER 5: Cover and Move,



    In this chapter the entire SEALs and irar soldiers were trying to make sure that the innocent people were safe or not and also rescued some people and moving them into the safer place by changing the position of the street and buildings by building, And also they were ready to do return attack if the enemies attacking them, Also the Team bulldog also working along with the SEALs and Iraq soldiers, bulldog team commander was a very well soldier and they also came up with the tanks and required guns and machine guns in order to support the entire SEAL and iraq team, Also the soldiers of bulldog was well trained and one of the best combat in the world, 

    The SEALs were splitted into two teams as OP1 and OP2, OP1 was led by charlie platoon’s officers and other OP2 led by an author at the war zone, at morning 2 am, they moved quite how possibile they can in the street to be in safer place, and it was just look like a hardcore place of it, at some time they raeched the location and they had a conversation that where they are with the op1 team, the radioman also replied with tyhe position details, at that time the enemies started to fire against the SEALs and iraq soldiers with the machine gun, also used the rocket launchers, and the SEALs also attacked them back with the guns and machine guns. They have shot two enemies and then they had very  hard time because of enemies attack, so as a leader author started convey the message as Cover and Move, 

    With this process, they started to cover somewhere they can hide, and it should work like if few people need to move, few crew members have to cover and fire against the enemies, and when they have to move the other few should follow the same method to move that, but this time author just looked only for his team not for the entire SEALs he was just focused on OP2 team which was led by him and forgot about the OP1 where they are struggling. And he realized that mistake  in the war zone in the worst situation. 

Conclusion: This is the most fundamental tactic, cover and move means a team work not as an individual one. All people in the team should work along with everyone as a team and accomplish the mission by supporting everyone in the team. In the path of success each member of the team is responsible and critical for that, if the team player or  leader can’t do  correctly then it will go into the consequences at most time. Cover and move will improve the team's understanding and can get the best results, it means help each other, support each other to win and work together. 


CHAPTER 6: Simple:


    While I read this chapter it was like playing a Battlefield or call of duty game which i was played before, and also remind me some hollywood action war strike movies, In this chapter the entire crew of SEALs, Navy, Iraq soldiers and team bulldog working together in that hardest place against the Mujahideen or al Qaeda, the small army and iraq soldiers were in riverbank, and the explosion of bomb or RPG-7 launchers blasts near by the compound wall where the author or commander hidden in that territory, also they informing and had a connection with the snipers at the watchers to make a best way to attack the enemies are trying to handle them with the guns and grenades, the building was caught by the SEALs by eliminating the enemies who  all were inside the building but it was the simple and first step. 

    The operation in this Ramadi was very cruel to everyone, and at some time commander had a conversation with the leader of MiTT leader and started to assign some seals to accompany him in that war zone, and he started to explain the plan to the Mitt leader but at first he was not able to understand what the commander said, but they have to do that, and at some time enemies started to attack the soldiers  in the field and the buildings, Leif was at another place and commander and Leif connected through the clear radio connection and shared the informations that two soldiers of Leif team injured  by an enemies attack and they need a medical support and fire support. And he was  in j51 building. The commande found that and moved to that building by informing the company leader. And at that time the team bulldog appeared with the tanks and machine guns then the enemies disappeared suddenly.

        But one of the soldiers died and another  one was still trying to be alive. It was really hard for the entire soldiers, in a gunfight they got attacked but the leader was supposed to help them at any cause, maybe the time can’t allow them to do that. 



Conclusion: when the plans collapsed the people do not think about the consequences and also forgot to understand whats happening they will went into wrong as well,plans and orders must be communicated in well mannered and also to know the  role of the person there and what can he/she do, As a  leader it will be the matter how you communicating the plan with the entire team, if anyone can’t understand that then it will never works. It is really critical to keep plans and communicate easily.




CHAPTER 7: Prioritize and Execute:



    In this chapter the author continued the entire experience of the warzone in Ramadi, The enemies attacking the soldiers rapidly without stopping, soldiers just got the cover and waiting to shoot them when they had a chance to revenge them, One seal officer ryan took a machine gun and firing against the enemies fearlessly with the deadly accuracy while the crosswire he assaulted the sheep in the pen. Pushing deep inside the enemy     territory was BTF- Big Tough Frogman it was a mantra of the charlie platoons, 

    In the geographic center of the city soldiers took a heavy gears with firepower into the enemy neighborhood, and they were in the surrounding of the enemies where they can roam and move without any constraints, before two weeks US army had a IED placed here and had a fight along with the tanks and machine guns also with RPG-7 machine guns. Vehicle graveyard would be the last safest place in Ramadi for them, in apartment building the SEALs has a better tactical position and provide protection, where the commander don’t want to leave the rest of IEDs to attack their team as well as the innocent people of iraq, so  he decided to clear it from that place. So he came to the ground and asked the troop to provide the security for him by using the smokes and firesupport, 

    While he did this enemies started to attack them rapidly and he got shocked but he knew that this place was fully occupied by the jihads, so they wanted to escape from there, so they broke down the wall and had another way to get out. But the situation was worse, the commander couldn't communicate with the other SEALs at that time so he got tense and thought about how  he could solve it, and then he came across  with the prioritize and execute. As first priority he wanted to help the person of the SEALs man and then used the bracher to cam out of it. After they get out of it there was an heavy blast.



Conclusion: The most important component of a leader is to tackle multiple problems or a number of tasks simultaneously and also he should know the priority of the task at a hard time and to execute it well. And evaluate high priority problem, lay out in simple, clear and concise terms  the highest priority, to maintain the ability to see the problems also while doing the task in at most hard times, and have to lead the team with the equal spirit of prioritize and execute, also should teach them to know how to handle these kind of pressures in any time while they got.



CHAPTER 8: Decentralized Command


    This chapter is explained about the Decentralized Command and also about how to implement it with the experience of the author while he served as a SEAL Commander. In this chapter, the continuation of previous one the enemies were located in the building tops with the harmful weapons and snipers, this information passed to the commander and then they ready to attack them and make sure that they had a safer place with the entire team, In that battlefield commander wants to implement the Decentralized command which means changing the leaders to see the rapid development in the warzone against the enemies, 

    Decentralized command means the leader should have a faith and believe on the subordinate leaders of the team, at that time the Ryan got shot by the enemies sniper in his eyes which leads to made him a blind for the entire lifetime, and the situation was getting worse for a seconds to seconds, in the team the younger persons are eager to learn and led the team in the battlefield, in that chaos they implemented the decentralized command and started to follow the lead with his ideas, also they had a MOUT training in the camps of SEALs which means a training of a combat attack. The enemies they are facing in Iraq don't have rules either.


    At some time commander thought that enemies snipers are located in the some of  the buildings, and the bradley’s fighting vehicle targeting on that building and confirming back whether it is correct info or not to give the support to the commander, so commander checked and said that they were in the building 94 and his troops are in the building 91, Also the Soldiers attacked some enemies sniper and then, commander mentioned that enemies are in the building 79 and then checked and informed back that nott in 79 they are in the top of building 94, but they all were the SEALs not an enemies and it found and replied by an bradley’s vehicle, because that time they were using the decentralized command it was implemented or else they will attacked that building as the commander said. 


Conclusion: Decentralized command is used to make effective commands on the fields and it will be used to get the effective results as back, the junior leader can communicate  easily with the senior officers in the warzone and can implement the plans that they have very different from others. Also it will empowered to make decisions and also it will make the junior to understand the problems and will practice them to  learn about the situational awareness, the best thing of an Decentralized command is getting the winning percentage, and aso by making the environment changes and dynamic leaders to make the correct decision at correct time, Decentralized command is key component of getting the victory.





CHAPTER 9: Plan :



    The al Qaeda kidnapped the teen of iraqi police colonel family and demanded the $50,000 as ransom and threatened that or else they will beheaded him, in Ramadi Kidnapping was came as an usual incident but after getting the money also they beheaded some people who all were kidnapped before, They used to tortured the people and killed them as an easy case, so it was an rescue mission and in this mission everyone should follows the plan given by the commander, before the plan they analyzed the mission with the  details got from an intelligence also found the place where they were located. So in this case, they planned as small SEALs would give the support until they get into the target and the snipers in watchers should passes the information and action happened there, and everyone was ready with vehicle to be started, at that time the another information came as they buried the IED and bunkered machine gun placed in the house, they were ready to fight back, 

    
    In that  situation also they had a hope on their clear plan and they believe that  it will be executed correctly, so they started the vehicle with the gears and required guns and went to nearby the location and the sniper confirmed that they can go into the target and they placed the bomb to make an entrance an once it was blast  they entered and within few seconds they cleared the field and rescued the hostages and went back with the same confidence, 
    Also the author shared this  experience with every student in the class to make the mental idea that if we had a better plan then we can make the success hundred percent by analysing the problem and the situation.



Conclusion:  As leader he/she should make the plan by analysing the missions and they should make clear ideas to the team as well. Plan will took the major place to solve the problem or the mission what we choose to complete, Also should share  the required stuff not only with his  group, leader should make this clear to entire team  if he/she is in an business organization, they should  guide the people to follow the checklist of all the important thing, and do not change the plan while  executing it correctly in correct place or else it will be a reason for the cause. And the checklist of it was analysing the mission, identifying personnel, assets, resources and time available. Decentralized the planning process, and should  continuously question the plan whether it goes in the correct way  or not, Brief the plan to others.  




CHAPTER 10: Leading up and down the Chain of Command:



    This chapter explained about the leading up and down the Chain of Command, and this will be the last for this SEALs here as they had been here for nearly six months, and the other SEAL crew will be here so they should return to the home, but both authors were felt sad and down as they can’t achieve something what they  supposed to do, and also they lost two soldiers here and ryan went to  hospital in germany with the wound in his eyes when the authors thought that  he will get the vision on other eye, but at that time they received the message that the ryan will be blind for his entire life time, it made them to felt bad for him and for themselves, as a leader they were the responsible  for the entire soldiers of the SEALs also as well as the supporting crew of iraq soldiers and the others, but they can’t save some people belongs to them, so they felt down very much and after that, jocko created the powerpoint slide that shows the requirement of changing a plan om battlefield, but the media and superiors of them didn’t understand that things and don’t want to listen to these stuffs, it made them to blaming on themselves. Some medias mentioned about the SEALs as they can fight without killing the jihads, but if they didn’t kill them then it would make the major consequences to soldiers and it will reduce the headcount  of returning home from battle ground also bad for the innocent people of iraq, after some time author realized that he didn’t make the clear  view to  others in the crew and also for the leaders.

Leading down the chain of Command:

    Good leader will lead  the team well and teach them to get in the path of success or towards the strategic goal, the new or junior of the team will accomplish the the tactical mission not the specific jobs of them,  they should learn such things insight of the seniors, Leaders should communicate with the team members and also should  explain the overall  operations or  mission they gonna do, as a extreme ownership if the team not performed well, the leader should examine himself before judging others in the team, leader should  know  the best communication way to explain it to the crew as simple and clear then they can understand. 



Leading up the chain of Command: 

    It means all  about if the leader or superior cannot making the decision in correct time or providing the support don't want to  blame them at first should examine ourselves as what we can do, and it means that tactful engagement with a person who made as a leader or superior suddenly to make decision and support to make the team to accomplish the mission in correct time, in this leader cannot change the authority so the  subordinate leader can experience and maintain the professional stuffs. And the most important role of leader is should support the own boss, in this leading up chain of command have  to be caution and also if the leader do not support then don’t want to blame on him except this can examine ourselves to clarify and educate ourselves.
Take responsibility, examine ourselves what changes and development we can do and inform the superior that what we are going to do and don’t wait for their commands to work.



CHAPTER 11: Decisiveness amid Uncertainty:

When they were in the Ramadi and they cleared few building in order to take the position and eliminating the enemies in the building and also on the roof tops they cleared and took a place, but chris said  to commander that he saw a silhouette of the boy with the scoped gun in the  window and then disappeared into the curtain, But they cleared that building too, even though chris was a best SEAL and the overwatch sniper in the team and also practicing the extreme ownership, so commander believes his words and contacted the warrior’s company commander, but the before that he came to understand that this place is already occupied by the jihads and they wounded many soldiers and also nearby 2nd street they shot the ryan in his eyes and also nearby 2 building they killed the marc lee, so they have to be conscious to don’t get the shot again and don’t want anyone to be killed again, so they have to be very careful in that places, 


Once the warrior’s company commander had a conversation with author or commander he said they already cleared the building at that sides and also asked him and chris to  open the fire on the boy once he appeared again, but the author or commander don’t want fire that guy without knowing that whether he is jihad or a anyone else, so he asked the warrior commander to send a men to clear the building first, but he refused to do that as his men might be shot by that guy and also it made a both commander in the pressured situation, but  warrior commander not working for him to obey the order and either the author also so he can’t fire as that man asked, so they had some conversation, at  that time the guy again appeared in the building so everyone got tense but commander made a decision to check the building before firing him, and this time warrior’s commander sent his men to check the building, once they went inside the building they came to know that the guy with scoped gun was a US army man with the authorised M16 sniper provided by the army, they really shocked and thanked a god to didn’t shoot the US army man at the battlefield, for this confusion they misunderstood the building count and commander mentioned the wrong building, warrior’s company commander has a experience so he understood the misjudge and thanked a god. 


Conclusion: Whatever the situation the leader should be decisive amid uncertainty, and the leader needs to understand the situations and also take a stand on the correct decisions at any time. Every decision cannot be a success but you have to decide that with the previous experiences and also should be comfortable under pressure and not emotion. In the hard situation it will be critical for the leaders to make the decision and also the best decision should be based on immediate information that they received. And also in the business not every decision will succeed but the leader should be in the place where he can act decisively amid uncertainty. 



CHAPTER 12: Discipline Equals Freedom-The Dichotomy of Leadership:



    In this chapter they went to collect the proofs and evidences in the captured building, at first it took long time to collect these stuffs and also for the records and and for iraq court they started to get the posters, maps, hard disks, tapes and the thing what they felt suspicious also collected by them and at some time the commander found that the entire crew not worked with the discipline to collect the informations and evidences and also they refused to get some stuffs there, and it was noticed by commander after that he explained why they are collecting it and also said that they have to collect entire proofs and evidences with the discipline manners by doing the work correctly, also he said the responsibility and work should always based on the discipline and it will lead us into the proper way, after that the first building took a 40-45 minutes to collect these things and then they moved to second building and it took only 20-25 minutes and after that in third building it took just 10-15 minutes to collect the proofs, and the author also explained about the early morning while waking up everyone in the camp for training, it has three alarms the first one rang and the commander inform everyone that the first alarm rang and it means if the person wake up from the bed to the ground he/she was pass, or the person rests more than that with the mental weakness then he/she was fail in it,

    In this case, discipline is the first thing that define the people in any time, whether he is good or bad in his work or responsibility, also found that increasing the discipline will give more freedom, and the lies we heard that discipline means strict order and control that opposite to freedom, while  reading this I got that discipline is the pathway to freedom. 



Conclusion: Discipline is the major thing that makes leadership into challenging tasks. Leadership is to know about the equals of extreme and one another of qualities. The leader should follow the discipline and also make everyone follow the same. That is also the responsibility of the leader. And the leader must make the new decisions and know the junior person's growth, also looking forward to accomplishing the goal without thinking about ego and personal stuff and agendas. Good leaders do not intimidate the new persons and also don’t seek recognition while the team is successful, a leader must be calm and also strategic.  And also take the responsibility to change or achieve something new. Also read the line that “Good leaders have nothing to prove, but everything to  prove”. 

    And a good leader should be confident, courageous, competitive, strong, humble, aggressive and also close with the team, not with the one, with all persons in the team. Also should be able to execute the Extreme ownership.

In this book I learnt about very  new things such as how the leader must be in the team and also read the applications of these in the business. It was very useful to understand such things clearly, and will try to practice extreme ownership in my upcoming days.
