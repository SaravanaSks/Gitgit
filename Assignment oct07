ALGORITHM TO REARRANGE THE 100 NUMBERS;


Analysing the problem.
If you can understand
If it's easy try to solve 
If not try to understand the problem
If not check with the system to solve it
If you get a hint, try to solve it. 
If not analyse the numbers where it is placed.
If  you analysed use the comparison method
Like num1 < with each numbers of 100
If it lesser than any number
Keep it in same place
If not lesser than that number
Rearrange it
Compare the num 2 with each  number
If it lesser than any number
Keep it in same place
If not lesser than that number
Rearrange it
Use same method as loop to comparing one number to another number
Do loop until rearrange 
Find the answer
 

I think the generic method  is a Loop, So i used it.
