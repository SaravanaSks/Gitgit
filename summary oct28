SUMMARY Oct-28:


    
Today, After went to office, I started to learn about the compiler, how it works and why it's important in programming, Also about what kind of functions it need and how the way it translating the human language into understandable machine language, and also tried to know how to create the own compiler with the required information. And also written down the symbols, tokens, sentences which will be used in the compiler.


After that, I looked to create the table to display the input elements of the UI which I started to design, and that table should shows the overall inputs of the fields, and tried to to that by learning some commands of js, but it was not worked so then used the required command to show the input of that fields and then tried to the alert with the lael name of the values gonna given in the fields. Also torchered a few people in the office to clarify my doubts and how to implement that in the design with javascripts, and then created the table in HTML and tried to link it with the javascript which I was already using. But after that also it wont work properly and my mentor saw that and asked to leave that with the alert along with label name and values,


After that he asked me to create the javascript which will used to store the data of one  field in an array and then refreshed the fields for the next entry of an inputs,  and also told that  it can create by using the object and arrays in the program then can store the values given in the text field should in an array. So then I started to learn about how I can work with that, and also tried to do that in a program, but this also did not work as usual as my previous work. Shit happens.


After that Anna came and started the culture talks, and today he spoke about Friendship and being friendly, as usual he talked in his style and started to train our brains to think in other perspective than what we used to be, and also said how to develop the taste and then only we can get the same mentality or similar group as friends, And also learnt to be friendly with everyone and have to be curious to know the other person or strangers story and their experience in their life because everyone has a different views in the way they passed by, until he said this I’m always been in my own thoughts but trying to listen to people at sometimes, but after this I think to be like always curious to know the experience and should be friendly with everyone I gonna see, 





And then also explained about don’t want to depend on someone else in the life, after the session asked some doubts and clarifications about the session and our personal experience, when he explained that i was wondered about him how he knows everything in practical and explaining in detail without boring, and It was really nice to hear and trying to do it from that time.
