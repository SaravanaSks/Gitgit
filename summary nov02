SUMMARY-Nov 02:


Today after I went to office, i started to study about the function and also about the execution stack how it works and how to create the program by using the correct function syntax and also about the function inside the function, At that I found how to create the function inside the function, after that I started to design the UI which is still pending, in that I changed the alignment in correct order as per the design given by my mentor, So i concentrated on it to complete it, at some time I completed the alignment works after focused on the checkbox to get the values of  it into the array for the use. 



For that I got stuck and unable to do that thing, so again learn about how the checkboxes are works in the program by using the javascripts, and then tried some other ways to get the value by using some commands, then i got  the empty string of that checkboxes  without the value, and then I started to learn about how to get the exact value of it, and i found a command and learnt about it how it should work, so tried that but that also doesn’t work, So I asked doubts to few people and they gave some hint to do that, and then I tried to do that, but that time also it was not work, and then torchered few peoples again to clarify my doubts, and then shereen cleared my doubt to get the value of the checkboxes into the  string first and then she gave some hint to get the value into the array, so I used the push command to push the value into an array, and then checked whether it works or  not it can get the value but can’t get the multiple value in it, so I started to learn about it, and still trying to do that.


And then Koushik started the session about the functions and execution stack again to clear our doubts in it, and again he wrote some simple programs then explained us  how the control works in the program and also taught us about the execution stack and in that session I learnt how the function inside function works as per the program written, he also  explained  everything about this stuffs very clearly. After that Abraham anna took a session about the loops and how it works, also about the syntax of it. In tat session he explained about for and while loop also said for loop is nothing but rewritten of while loop, and we practiced that in the console to get the proper view of it, 

And then in afternoon, he taught us about If conditions and switch, and explained why the if condition and switch are using in the programming language, and also explained about the difference between these commands, and said tomorrow he will teach about UI so looking for it to learn such things.
