SUMMARY 01/10/21:


Today, this morning I have been in the session with the Askin he taught as some comments which we are gonna use in our future and also he taught as very clearly and politely, At the initial steps again I have learnt how to create the File of Folder in terminal clearly and also He asked to do the same in our laptops while he taught how to use the command lines and that was the easiest way to learn such things, From previous day I gone through how to create the folder, how to  move and copy the folder, how to rename the folder by using the command lines,
 
    And today He taught some more commands uses to access the system which were very new to me, Also asked some doubts he cleared that nicely and the I just know we have to be excited to learn new things which we don’t know, and it will make a new path to us to wonder how is world runs along with the Techs and Computers,


    After the session I have practiced the command lines what he taught, and in sometime I have very cleared about it and also searched some few things related to this in the internet, and then I have contacted my mentor to know what i can learn, my mentor gave me 3 puzzles to solve, Before one week if I had any problems I just sat and was thinking about how to solve it and it will take more than one or two days, after I knew how to see the problem my automatically thinking about what are the constraints it has and to understand the problem, and listing the possibilities and the rearranged the possibilities in proper order, in that case i have took upto 3hrs to solve that puzzles by using the Problem solving method. Also discussed with other people to know that my answer was correct. Once I Confirmed that I’ve got the Correct answer then only my mind got relaxed, it was very nice to work my mind which was unable to work for past few months.


    And then a late afternoon Demo meeting was conducted. Actually I don’t know what it means, Once they started everyone was doing presentation and shared their work what was they do for a week, also said every Friday they will conduct the demo meet to know the things what they doing and best way to interact with all. After they did their presentation They asked every interns to do the same as what they learnt for a week, so everyone took a best part by shared their experience and the things they learnt, And then I’ve took my part of it ann explained what I did for that week, It was really very difficult for me because I didn’t even stand before the group of people, I was very nervous to do and When I started I got stucked and stopped because trembling, also I  overcame with it and faced everyone with little confident for the first time ever, and I’m damn sure I will practiced to do that by every demo meet.

    After 6.30pm they took us to the turf to play football and shuttle. After 6 months I have played football and it was very nice to be active all the time. And back to our room, Askin bro came by 11pm and we talked a lot about how to improvise ourselves by learning with our efforts and he asked us to be excited all the time to learn the things. I  learnt to do new things and came to know that I am practicing that everyday.
